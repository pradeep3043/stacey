<b>About the Installation</b>

Every year, during the convocation at National Institute of Design, each department portrays their discipline, with a display/installation. We, from New Media Design, created an installation involving hybrid space between both physical and digital media. Visitors interacted with the digital butterflies, flying on the physical painted artwork.

The team worked on different modules, involving artwork, physical computing, space design and interaction design.
