<b> Summary </b>

An experimental movie, using metaphors of colors to denote the challenges of going through the journey of life.

The hurdles each individual perceives with initial boundaries from learning things that are accessible to him to exploring the inaccessible world. As he tries to explore and come out of it, the challenges are perceived as easier or difficult for him. The colors denote the challenges from warmer red to cooler blue against a black background as life. This project is an expression of the idea that, as an individual overcome challenges and hurdles to go farther and higher in life, the constraints constantly seem to get bigger as well, repressing him and smothering his progress.
